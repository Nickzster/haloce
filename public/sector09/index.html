          Welcome to Sector 09, a Halo 3: ODST themed firefight for Halo Custom
          Edition. You will learn quickly in Sector 09 that there are a unique
          variety of enemies that will attack you at every corner. Sector 09
          promises that every firefight experience is unique. This is because
          Sector 09 is designed to spawn enemies randomly.

      <h1 class="title">Sector 09 Wave Progression</h1>
      <section class="firefight-information card">
        <p class="container">
          As mentioned previously, this firefight takes a major inspiration from
          Halo 3: ODST. It behaves and functions very similar to Halo 3: ODST.
          Defeating five waves completes one round, and defeating three rounds
          completes one set.The first two sets in Sector 09 are considered to be
          "normal" difficulty. However, once you begin Set 3 (Wave 31),
          "Legendary mode" will activate. This guarantees that the firefight
          will send you the most difficult, challenging, and most importantly
          fun encounters that Sector 09 has to offer.

          <h2>2012</h2>
          <p class="container">
            -Firefight Sector 09 was conceived<br />
            -Massive BSP provided many opportunities, including the idea of
            minigames<br />
            -Unfortunately, the BSP size would prove too large, and would later
            be redesigned several times.
          </p>
          <h2>2014</h2>
          <p class="container">
            -Alpha video is released <br />
            -New BSP is designed after many issues (Gameplay, Scale, ETC.)
            <br />
            -However, this new BSP would prove to be too claustrophobic and even
            worse gameplay. <br />
            -Motivation is very slim
          </p>
          <h2>2015</h2>
          <p class="container">
            -Polyonymous is formed, with members from VKMT. <br />
            -Polyonymous attempts to finish Sector 09 as an easy project for the
            young mapping team. <br />
            -New BSP is designed, which would take stage in CE3 2015 <br />
            -Sector 09 reaches points never achieved before, with the CE3 2015
            trailer. <br />
            -Unfortunately, in October of 2015, Polyonymous breaks up due to
            personal issues, and production on Sector 09 is halted.
          </p>
          <h2>2016</h2>
          <p class="container">
            -Nickster5000 draws up, yet again, a new BSP concept and decides to
            model it to see how it looks in Halo CE.<br />
            -The results of the new BSP are absolutely phenomenal <br />
            -After new encounters are tested, gameplay proves to be very fun
            <br />
            -All resources / Efforts are combined from last 4 years of Sector 09
            development into this version. <br />
