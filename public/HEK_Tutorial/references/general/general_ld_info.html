    <font face="Arial" size="2">The following are some aesthetic or stylistic 
    suggestions and guidelines when creating new content or levels for Halo 
    multiplayer:</font><p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) Halo multiplayer levels tend to be 
    stylistically part of the universe from a design and aesthetics point of 
    view, borrowing geometry or architectural elements from the single player 
    game environments.&nbsp; However, the multiplayer levels tend to be removed 
    from the narrative portion of the Halo universe.&nbsp; This allows a Halo 
    multiplayer level to look and feel like Halo while offering a great degree 
    of freedom.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) Human structures, ships, vehicles, weapons 
    and other related elements are military themed.&nbsp; The human technology 
    style is relatively near future with obvious advanced technology but it is 
    all recognizable and functional without being overly complex or &quot;gadgety&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The color palette tends to follow the aforementioned military theme with 
    darker greens (olive drab), various metallic colors (gun metal, burnished 
    aluminum), dark grays or blacks, as well as various browns.&nbsp; The 
    construction style tends to be angular with 30 degree and 45 degree angles 
    being standard.</font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">3) Covenant structures, vehicles, ships, 
    weapons and other related elements are heavily sci-fi themed.&nbsp; The 
    Covenant technology is far more advanced than comparative human technology 
    but not as advanced as the Forerunner technology.&nbsp; The color palette 
    for the Covenant tend to be various metallic reds, blues and purples.&nbsp; 
    These same colors are also used for their energy fields or shields and other 
    luminous elements found on Covenant objects.&nbsp; The construction style 
    tends to be organic utilizing smooth curves and rounded surfaces.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">4) The Halo structures or Forerunner 
    structures and the technology they contain are far more advanced than either 
    Human or Covenant technology.&nbsp; These structures tend to be massive and 
    distinctly &quot;alien&quot; yet elegant when compared to the Human or Covenant 
    objects and structures.&nbsp;&nbsp; External covenant structures tend to 
    have smooth metallic surfaces with large or bold architectural features.&nbsp; 
    Interior structures tend to be larger (compared to Human-sized rooms or 
    hallways) almost cathedral-like in many instances with some common elements 
    such as pillars, illuminated control panels and wall panels, as well as 
    various alien machinations.&nbsp; The color palette for Forerunner 
    structures tends to stick to metallic colors such silver with blues, 
    purples, and yellows being common for the luminous elements found in the 
    Forerunner structures. The inner surface of the Halo ring and its terrain 
    and thus associated colors tend to vary.&nbsp; Even though many of the 
    environments do not appear in the game it is assumed that Halo has all the 
    environments found on Earth (except geological formations and features 
    related to geothermal or volcanic activity such as volcanoes or geysers).&nbsp; 
    These environments include rolling plains and grasslands, deserts, oceans, 
    lakes, beaches, islands, forests, snow and ice covered canyons, etc...

  <tr>
    <td width="100%" height="1" bordercolorlight="#C0C0C0" bordercolordark="#C0C0C0">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Here are some technical rules, guidelines 
    and tips that apply to creating Halo multiplayer levels:</font><p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">1) Halo levels currently HAVE to support ALL 5 
    game types (Capture the Flag (CTF), Race, Slayer (Deathmatch), King of the 
    Hill (KOTH), Oddball) in order to function properly within the game engine.&nbsp; 
    Missing the netgame flags or necessary elements (the netgame flags for the 
    objectives, player spawns, etc...) for these game modes can cause the game 
    or server to crash or have problems.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Supporting all the game modes in the level 
    also insures consistency with the design of Halo multiplayer and cuts down 
    on the confusion that having game mode specific levels would create.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2)&nbsp; Adequate player spawns.&nbsp; It is suggested 
    that a minimum of 16 player spawns per TEAM (red or blue) 
    for each game mode.&nbsp; Player spawns can actually be set up to be used 
    for more than 1 game type. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A multiplayer level should have 16 player 
    spawns per game type for the level regardless of what the level description 
    says or what the level was designed for.&nbsp; There is a very high chance 
    that a server operator will&nbsp; run the level with 16 players, having 
    adequate spawns will keep the game and player spawning behaving properly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">3) Minimum distance between player spawns.&nbsp; 
    The distance between player spawns should be 20 units apart or greater for 
    non-team game modes and 2.5 units apart or greater for team based game 
    modes.&nbsp; The Halo spawning code is unique.&nbsp; For Capture the Flag, 
    the spawns do have the concept of team or side so players should never spawn 
    in the enemy base or on the enemy side of the level.&nbsp; For other game 
    types, either team or non-team, the spawning code will try and spawn the 
    player near friendly players and avoid spawning the player if an enemy 
    player is within a certain distance of the spawn point.&nbsp; If two or more 
    spawn points are within the minimum distance stated above, then it is 
    possible that a player will not be allowed to spawn at one of the 
    neighboring spawn points if an enemy player spawns or has spawned at another 
    neighboring spawn point (at least until they move out of the minimum safe 
    distance).&nbsp; Understanding how Halo spawns players in the various game 
    modes and team settings is very important in the design of the level and 
    placement of spawns.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">4) Physics.&nbsp; Halo has physics, keep this 
    in mind at all times.&nbsp; Physics is fun, but can also be crazy to design 
    for.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">5) Collision.&nbsp; Be aware of Halo physics 
    when constructing geometry.&nbsp; Thin geometry that is part of the world 
    mesh is very likely to cause collision problems, typically the player or a 
    vehicle will go straight through it.&nbsp; Larger and thicker geometry is 
    better for collision.&nbsp; For trees and other objects such as rocks, use 
    scenery models when possible and even with these make their manually created 
    collision models simple and robust.</font></p>

    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Here are some basic game design or level 
    design    guidelines and tips that directly apply to Halo multiplayer levels:&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) Keep the level simple.&nbsp; A level can 
    have a simple layout yet still offer a great depth of game play for all the 
    Halo game types (Bloodgulch, Timberland and Danger Canyon are good examples 
    of this).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) Try to support all the Halo game types 
    well.&nbsp; Most Halo multiplayer levels support some game modes extremely 
    well while the other game modes in the level are not as fun or offer as good 
    of a game play experience. This is the most challenging aspect of Halo 
    multiplayer level design.&nbsp; Some level ideas or concepts may not work 
    well with some game types, but its still possible to support the game types 
    and not only make them playable, but enjoyable.&nbsp; Maps that support all 
    the game modes well tend to be the more popular and </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">3) The more popular Halo levels tend to be 
    symmetric in layout but with balanced asymmetrical features that add variety 
    without giving one side a distinct advantage over the other (in team games).&nbsp; 
    Asymmetrical features can be anything including terrain features, cover such 
    as trees and rocks, even items such as power ups and weapons.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">4) Bases or base areas.&nbsp; The more 
    balanced and well rounded levels have 2 distinct team areas or team bases.&nbsp; 
    Bases should have multiple entrances and exits to facilitate movement into 
    and out of the base and to prevent bottlenecks.&nbsp; Keep in mind the fact 
    that vehicles can be driven and\or &quot;tweaked&quot; into just about any area.&nbsp; 
    Vehicles are very effective at blocking off travel routes, design the base 
    area and entrances, exits, and access ramps and areas accordingly.</font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">5) A Halo multiplayer level does not have to 
    have every vehicle in it to be fun, do not force a level to have a certain 
    vehicle in it if its not designed for it.&nbsp; Timberland was designed for 
    ground based combat and vehicles and contains no Banshees, where as Infinity 
    was designed for the Banshee and Banshees work very well in that level.</font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">6)&nbsp; Balancing the level for the player 
    on foot versus the player in a vehicle is crucial.&nbsp; This applies to the 
    travel times and distances for a player on foot versus a player in a vehicle 
    and the combat between a player on foot or a player in a vehicle (give the 
    player on foot terrain features and cover against vehicles).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">7) Teleporters are a very good tool, but are 
    very easy to abuse.&nbsp; Remember that the player can take the flag through 
    a teleporter.&nbsp; Keep in mind that teleporters can be made one way.&nbsp; 
    Only players can go through teleporters, no matter how big the size of the 
    teleporter, therefore teleporters are good ways to balance the travel 
    distances and times between players on foot and players in vehicles.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">8) Balance the weapons and item placement.&nbsp; 
    Use these items to create or control traffic or game flow in certain areas 
    of the level.&nbsp; More powerful weapons should be towards the middle of 
    the level or require the player to travel a farther distance to get.&nbsp; 
    This also holds true also for items and powerups.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">9) Halo has physics!&nbsp; As was mentioned 
    above in the technical section, keep this fact in mind at all times.&nbsp; 
    Take advantage of it (ramps and jumps are fun with vehicles) and try not to 
    abuse it or allow it to be abused\exploited by the player. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">10) Make sure to keep the player (and 
    vehicles) out of places where they should not be!&nbsp; Use obstacles, sky, 
    and player clipping to keep players from cheating or exploiting the level.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">11) Keep in mind that vehicles (especially 
    Warthogs and Ghosts) can be tweaked or manipulated into areas that they 
    should probably not be.&nbsp; Players will always try to block important 
    level paths or objectives with vehicles.&nbsp; While these can be valid 
    tactics, make sure that such tactics do not &quot;break&quot; the level or limit the 
    game play in the level.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">12) Most importantly, be creative!</font></p>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">The values listed are a general guideline due to 
    the fact that performance is affected by many factors other than triangle 
    counts such as the number and type of materials (shaders) in the scene, 
    sounds, dynamic lights, lens flares, and other game objects.</font><p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As can be expected, the fewer triangles being 
    drawn the better.&nbsp; When creating a level, the level designer should 
    always take into the account additional triangle counts added by vehicles, 
    players, weapons, items, and effects and prepare for any worst case 
    scenarios in terms of triangle counts and rendering.</font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When creating a level, its always a good idea 
    to view a similar level that exists in the original game and see what kind of 
    triangle counts exist per scene at various areas of the level.&nbsp; 
    Checking the triangle counts and other rendering information as well as the 
    frame rate and performance in those areas should give a good baseline during 
    the development of your own multiplayer environment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The level designer should also realize that 
    the triangle counts for a scene compared to the polygon counts for a scene 
    when constructed or viewed in 3DSMax may vary greatly depending on the 
    material used and how that material is rendered in the game. Often, the 
    surface has to be rendered multiple times for the applied material and 
    associated rendering effects and properties set for that material or shader.&nbsp;
    </font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A simple example, a ladder is constructed 
    with 2 polygons in 3DSMax and a ladder shader is applied to it with the 
    2-sided property flag checked in the shader due to the fact that the ladder 
    can be viewed from all angles.&nbsp; In game, this 2 polygon ladder will 
    show a triangle count of 4 since BOTH sides are rendered, the back side or 
    back face is not being culled and must be drawn.</font></p>

    <font size="2" face="Arial">As was mentioned above, the performance of a 
    multiplayer level is dependant upon many factors, not just the pure number 
    of triangles being drawn.</font><p></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Below is a simple list of things to keep in 
    mind when creating a level for Halo:</font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) The 50,000 maximum triangle value listed 
    for multiplayer levels is a rough average, keeping the triangle count to 
    around 30,000 triangles per scene or less is a great range to insure 
    smoother performance on a wider variety of machines. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">9) Performance is a balancing act.&nbsp; 
    Knowing the general rules and knowing the technology will allow you to 
    exceed some limits or boundaries by decreasing or limiting others.&nbsp; For 
    example, making a scene that is higher in triangle counts than normal but 
    lower in overall material or shaders types that are also of a lower 
    complexity is a common trade off.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Avoid using a lot of lens flares in 
    general or lens flares per scene, such as the colored beacons used for 
    marking team areas of the level.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Dynamic lights are very, very expensive 
    performance-wise.&nbsp; Limit your use of them or eliminate your use of them 
    all together.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">4) The number of different materials or 
    shader types per scene can greatly affect performance.&nbsp; Having a room 
    with all the vehicles, weapons, and items (each has its own unique material 
    or shader for the most part) as well as different materials all over the 
    room can be very costly.&nbsp; Try to limit the unique number of materials 
    per scene.</font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">5) Avoid using or creating a lot of shaders 
    that have a lot of effects or settings or that require multiple rendering 
    passes, this can greatly decrease performance.&nbsp; Shaders with a base 
    map, primary detail map, secondary detail map, micro detail map, bump map, 
    scrolling texture settings, specular properties, and reflection cube map all 
    set decreases rendering performance and uses up more memory.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">7) Certain shader effects such as the 
    &quot;dynamic mirror&quot; flag under Reflection Properties for .shader_environments 
    are extremely expensive, do not use these shaders or use these shader 
    properties.</font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">6) Watch the amount of overdraw created by 
    having successive layers of transparent or partially transparent geometry 
    (e.g. several layers of glass, looking through several waterfalls or other 
    similar transparent particle effects)</font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">8) Be careful of the number of ambient sounds 
    placed in the level using .sound_scenery tags.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">9) Take into account the triangles rendered 
    in the sky or sky box model you have chosen for the level.&nbsp; Also take 
    into account the model materials and shaders and number of shaders chosen 
    for the sky box model or used in the sky box model.&nbsp; The triangles for 
    the skybox do not get culled or not drawn the same as for world geometry 
    that has a visibility solution in place (portals).&nbsp; If possible, 
    simplify the skybox by making a custom skybox model.</font></p>
